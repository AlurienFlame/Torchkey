# Torchkey

Adds a hotkey to place a torch from your hotbar.

Inspired by [The Middle Torch](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-middle-torch) by [HenryLoenwind](https://www.curseforge.com/members/henryloenwind/followers), an excellent mod which sadly has not been updated for over a year.

This mod requires [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).
